        ðŸ”¸ This is the concept of shallow copy. In 'shallow copy' the copy of new array is not created only the reference of original is passed to the
        new array, or we can say new name of an array created and point towards the old array only. If we change the value in a new array, the value will also be changed in
        an old array.

        * The difference b/w shallow copy and deep coy is in shallow copy ref. is passed and in deep copy the original copy of an array is created.
